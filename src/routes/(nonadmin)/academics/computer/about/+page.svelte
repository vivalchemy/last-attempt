                As per the World Economic Forum report, 4th Industrial revolution
                represents a fundamental change in the way we live, work, and relate
                to one another. It will impact every aspect of life by enabling smart
                technologies. To enable smart technologies, the program Incorporates a
                wide range of topics in computer engineering like Artificial
                Intelligence, Big Data Analytics, Block-Chain, Internet of Things,
                with basic technologies like computer programming, Computer Networking
                Database management system, computing Technologies, Programming
                languages, and algorithms. Department has adopted Project-based
                learning approach which helps students to explore various thrust
                application areas and apply principles of Computer technology across
                multidisciplinary field.

                The department conducts various training programs to help faculty and
                students to improve their technical knowledge. The department has
                fetched research grants from MODROB and Minor Research Grant of Mumbai
                University for Innovative Projects. It has signed MoU with several
                companies like Suven Consultant and Technology Pvt. Ltd, Indian
                Institute of Remote Sensing (IRS) Outreach Programme, crypto
                university, AWS, LPI Canada, EC council Academia, and Tata Consultancy
                Services (TCS). Graduates of our department have been recruited by
                major IT companies such as BrowserStack, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan
                Chase, ZS, TIAA, Seclore, Quantiphi, Carwale, SAP, Amdocs, TCS,
                Accenture, to name a few. Department has made conscious efforts to
                develop the department as a center of excellence in the field of
                Machine learning.

                To gain practical exposure to real-world engineering challenges,
                enhancing theoretical knowledge with hands-on applications, students
                undergo Internships which enables them to work alongside industry
                professionals, gaining valuable insights and practical skills that
                can't be learned solely in the classroom. Students have pursued
                Internships in JP Morgan, Quantiphi, TIAA, etc. Students are
                encouraged to undertake certification courses on platforms like Udemy,
                Coursera, NPTEL, and IIRS that tailor education to their career
                aspirations. Both internships and certifications not only bolster our
                student's resume but also contribute significantly to their overall
                growth as future engineers. Many students aspire to pursue higher
                studies to further their academic and career goals through admission
                to renowned universities like IIM Ahmedabad, IIM Indore, Carnegie
                Mellon University, Buffalo university, Massachusetts Institute of
                Technology, to name a few.
