	<p class="description">Greetings and a very warm welcome to CRCE!</p>
	<p class="description">
		I have great pleasure in expressing my thoughts as the Principal of Fr. Conceicao Rodriuges
		College of Engineering: a prestigious, self-financed institute affiliated to University of
		Mumbai. Maharashtra and approved by AICTE. Fr CRCE was established in 1984 with a vision of '<strong
			>Moulding Engineers who can Build the Nation</strong
		>' inspired by the dream of our founder Rev. Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues. Fr. CRCE aspires to be a
		center of excellence in engineering education, moulding engineers with the state-of-the art
		technologies, innovative skills and human values matching with the growing expectations of the
		corporates and the society and thus play an effective role in nation building.

		Education makes one more well-informed and knowledgeable. Both of these will help to enhance
		critical thinking skills needed to make good decisions in every walk of life. Education must
		prepare aspiring minds for '<strong>Marathon</strong>' and make them '<strong>Life-Long</strong
		>' Learner. In this era of globalization of education the obvious focus is on the quality of
		education. It is the right of our students to get quality education as it gives huge
		opportunities for better living and supports our nation's prosperity. There is no single
		yardstick for the quality. A good educational institute strives continuously for enhancement of
		quality in every field of its activity. Fr. CRCE makes consistent and sincere efforts towards
		this. Recently the world has seen unprecedented and extraordinary disruptions in all walks of
		life including education. We need to create engineers who are flexible enough to adapt new
		changes, develop new technologies and also behave as responsible citizens of the country.
		Engineers & technologists form the backbone of any nation's economic development. Responsibility
		of speeding up the nation's economic wheel lies on Engineers and Technocrats. A new normal has
		already arrived in education system. With the introduction of NEP-2020 an ambitious policy of
		Government of India many new concepts are introduced in education system like Multidisciplinary
		exposure to learners, Academic Bank of Credits, Multiple Entry & Exit, Holistic Development of
		Students, Outcome Based Education, industry linkages and more autonomy to institutes. Fr. CRCE
		is looking forward to successfully implement these policies as and when possible by
		restructuring the academics that create research culture and encouraging holistic development of
		students.

		Institute is dedicated in '<strong>Making Difference in Life of the Stakeholders</strong>' With
		the support of dedicated and hardworking faculty and staff, the institute has achieved
		remarkable visibility and ranking. Our splendid academic performance, sparkling placements,
		enrollment for higher studies at the best places of the world, prizes won by our students in
		national/international competitions in past
